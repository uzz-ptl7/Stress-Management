            <h1>What is Stress?</h1>
            <p>Stress is a normal psychological and physical reaction to events that make us feel threatened or upset our balance in some way. 
                When we sense danger, whether it's real or imagined, our body's "fight or flight" response is triggered, releasing stress 
                hormones like adrenaline and cortisol into our bloodstream.</p>

        <h1 class="main-h1">Causes of Stress</h1>
        <section id="causes-of-stress">
            
            <ul>
                <h2><li>Work-related pressures</li></h2>
                <p>Work-related pressures cause stress due to excessive workloads, tight deadlines, lack of control, unclear expectations, 
                    poor work-life balance, job insecurity, conflicts, insufficient support, long hours, and poor working conditions. 
                    These factors lead to anxiety, burnout, strained relationships, and overall mental and physical exhaustion.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Financial difficulties</li></h2>
                <p>Financial difficulties cause stress due to insufficient income, high debt, and unexpected expenses, leading to constant 
                    worry about basic needs. This stress strains relationships, impacts mental health, and limits growth opportunities, 
                    creating a challenging cycle of anxiety and hardship.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Relationship problems</li></h2>
                <p>Relationship stress arises from conflicts, misunderstandings, and lack of communication. Factors include trust issues, 
                    infidelity, differing expectations, and financial disputes. Balancing personal needs with the relationship, dealing 
                    with extended family, and managing work-life balance further contribute. These challenges can lead to emotional strain, 
                    anxiety, and decreased well-being.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Major life changes</li></h2>
                <p>Major life changes, such as marriage, divorce, moving, job changes, or the death of a loved one, can cause significant 
                    stress. These events disrupt routines, create uncertainty, and demand emotional adjustment. The need to adapt quickly 
                    to new circumstances can lead to anxiety, overwhelm, and decreased mental well-being.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Health concerns</li></h2>
                <p>Health concerns cause stress through chronic illnesses, acute medical conditions, and uncertainty about diagnoses or 
                    treatments. These issues can lead to anxiety about physical well-being, financial burdens from medical expenses, and 
                    the impact on daily activities and relationships, ultimately affecting overall mental and emotional health.</p>

        <h1 class="main-h1">Symptoms of Stress</h1>
        <section id="symptoms-of-stress">
            
            <ul>
                <h2><li>Headaches and migraines</li></h2>
                <p>Headaches and migraines are common symptoms of stress, often resulting from muscle tension and increased sensitivity to 
                    pain. Stress triggers the body's fight-or-flight response, causing hormonal changes that can lead to these painful 
                    episodes. Persistent stress can exacerbate the frequency and severity of headaches and migraines.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Fatigue and insomnia</li></h2>
                <p>Fatigue and insomnia are common symptoms of stress. Stress can lead to constant tiredness, lack of energy, and difficulty 
                    concentrating. It often disrupts sleep patterns, causing trouble falling or staying asleep, resulting in insomnia. 
                    This creates a cycle where lack of rest further exacerbates stress, impacting overall health and well-being.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Difficulty concentrating</li></h2>
                <p>Difficulty concentrating is a common symptom of stress, resulting from the brain's struggle to manage overwhelming 
                    thoughts and anxiety. Stress hormones like cortisol can impair cognitive functions, making it hard to focus, process 
                    information, and make decisions. This mental fog can hinder productivity and daily functioning.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Irritability and mood swings</li></h2>
                <p>Irritability and mood swings are symptoms of stress, causing frequent shifts in mood and heightened sensitivity. 
                    Individuals may experience anger, frustration, or sadness over minor issues. This emotional instability affects 
                    relationships and daily interactions, further exacerbating stress and creating a cycle of emotional and mental strain.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Stomach problems and digestive issues</li></h2>
                <p>Stomach problems and digestive issues, such as indigestion, nausea, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are common 
                    symptoms of stress. Stress disrupts the digestive system by altering gut-brain communication and increasing stomach acid 
                    production, leading to discomfort and impaired digestion. Chronic stress can exacerbate these gastrointestinal issues.</p>

        <h1 class="main-h1">Managing Stress</h1>
        <section id="managing-stress">
            
            <p class="p-main">There are many effective ways to manage stress, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <h2><li>Exercise and physical activity</li></h2>
                <p>Exercise and physical activity effectively manage stress by releasing endorphins, which improve mood and reduce anxiety. 
                    Physical activity also lowers cortisol levels, promotes relaxation, and enhances sleep quality. Regular exercise provides 
                    a healthy outlet for tension, improving overall mental well-being and resilience against stress.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Meditation and mindfulness</li></h2>
                <p>Meditation and mindfulness help manage stress by promoting relaxation and mental clarity. Regular practice encourages 
                    present-moment awareness, reducing negative thoughts and emotional reactivity. These techniques improve focus, enhance 
                    emotional resilience, and lower stress hormone levels, fostering a sense of calm and well-being in daily life.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Deep breathing and relaxation techniques</li></h2>
                <p>Deep breathing and relaxation techniques manage stress by calming the nervous system and reducing cortisol levels. 
                    Practices such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation help slow the heart rate, lower blood 
                    pressure, and promote a sense of calm, effectively counteracting stress and enhancing emotional well-being.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Time management and prioritization</li></h2>
                <p>Time management and prioritization reduce stress by organizing tasks efficiently. Setting clear goals, prioritizing 
                    important activities, and breaking tasks into manageable steps prevent overwhelm. Effective scheduling and avoiding 
                    procrastination enhance productivity and provide a sense of control, thereby decreasing stress and improving overall 
                    well-being.</p>
                
                <h2><li>Seeking social support</li></h2>
                <p>Seeking social support helps manage stress by providing emotional comfort and practical assistance. Talking to friends, 
                    family, or support groups offers reassurance, advice, and a sense of connection. This support reduces feelings of 
                    isolation, provides perspective, and helps navigate stressful situations more effectively, enhancing overall resilience.</p>
